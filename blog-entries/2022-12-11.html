    <h1>Long Time No See (Restaurant Review)</h1>
    <hr>

    <p>
        I had the pleasure of stumbling on this restaurant near the Dongnae station this weekend.<br>
        It was early in the afternoon so there was not much traffic, but I am guessing there is a good crowd on the weekends.<br>
        The restaurant is Western themed with dishes like Spaghetti, Nachos, Wings & Fries, etc all reasonably priced. Most items are under 10k krw.<br>
        The biggest draw of the restaurant is the craft beers, the waiter gives you a digital wristband for convenience to pour your own beers.<br>
        The beer is charged per ml so you can try each one if you want for a very low price, and a full glass ranges in price from about 4,000 to 13,000 krw.<br><br>

        The restaurant is conveniently a block away from the subway<br><br>

        For appetizers they serve fresh popped popcorn!<br><br>

        The popcorn is served like theaters with butter and salt.<br><br>

        They have a large selection of craft beers.<br><br>

        They serve a large variety of western foods, I tried the oven baked spaghetti.<br><br>
