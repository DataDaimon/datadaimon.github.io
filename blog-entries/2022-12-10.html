    <h1>Hello World! First Post</h1>
    <hr>
    
    <p>
        Hello! This is my first post on the new website.<br>
        Previously I hosted my website on the domain datascience.monster using NameCheap for the domain registration and hosting.<br>
        The service was pretty great, I never had any issues and for my website and I was using wordpress to host and upload content.<br><br>
        
        However, after the introductory pricing the cost to renew hosting and the SSL certificate became pretty costly.<br>
        I discovered as a PhD student I could take advantage of the GitHub developer's student pack and get a free .me domain as well as host my website on GitHub pages.<br>
        This seemed like a great option and would save me at least $60 a year in fees plus GitHub offers a free SSL certificate so it was a pretty easy choice.<br>
        But I am still using Namecheap to register my domains because they offer free privacy protection which is about $10/yr per domain on other registrars.<br><br>
        
        I created this website from scratch doing all the coding by hand in a way that is simple and straightforward, and it saves me the headache and time of having<br>
        to deal with wordpress plugins and updates and navigating through C-panel.<br>
        Plus it's a lot of fun to get back to coding a website from scratch, it feels like jumping from Java to C and having a lot more control at your fingertips.<br><br>

        Anyway for the near future I look forward to updating this website, my GitHub and moving into new opportunities in Data Science, Machine Learning, and NLP.<br><br>
       
        Cheers,<br>
        Richard
