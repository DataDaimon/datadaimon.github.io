        <h3>Research & Projects</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="pdf/capstone.pdf">Predicting Invariant Mass of an Electron</a><br>
            Data Science can be utilized is in the analysis of the Petabytes of information generated by the CERN Particle 
            Accelerators in Geneva, Switzerland. In this research report we will analyze the data provided by the Compact
            Muon Solenoid as the particle accelerator attempts to trigger, reconstruct, and identify events with final state
            electrons.
        </p>

        <p>
            <a href="pdf/time_series.pdf">
                Time Series - Telecom Churn</a><br>
                For this analysis, the goal will be to use a Time Series to analyze data points in the Churn dataset to discover an internal structure. 
                In the Time series we will generate a thorough accounting of our findings such as seasonal variation or trends. 
                Two objectives are to provide information on stationarity and autocorrelated data which will assist stakeholders and executives with insight into 
                corporate business metrics.
        </p>

        <p>
            <a href="pdf/sentiment_analysis.pdf">
                Sentiment Analysis using Neural Networks</a><br>
                The objective of this assessment is to create a NLP Neural Network to analyze the UCI Sentiment Labeled Sentences dataset. 
                The dataset contains three subsets of customer reviews from wildly popular review sites including IMDB, Amazon, and Yelp.
                 We can accomplish this objective by utilizing the TensorFlow Python library to analyze and forecast negative or positive sentiment. 
                 The overall goal of the analysis is to assist stakeholders and executives in making informed decisions based on the analyzed metrics of 
                 customer preference by using text classification to produce useful predictions.
        </p>

        <p>
            <a href="pdf/eda.pdf">Exploratory Data Analysis</a><br>
            In our conclusion to TIM-8501 Exploratory
            Data Analysis we will revisit each component of the EDA process including Measures of
            variability and central tendency, frequency, variance, and standard deviation, outlier detection
            and distribution modality, univariate analysis methods, and cluster analysis and data grouping. In
            this analysis we will use the NCU provided dataset 2019 CPS Food Security. The goal of this
            research study is to understand the data better before making assumptions by examining
            variables through cluster analysis or segmentation.
