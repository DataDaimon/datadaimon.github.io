            <a href="pdf/capstone.pdf">Predicting Invariant Mass of an Electron</a><br>
            This research report analyzes petabytes of information generated by the CERN Particle Accelerator in Geneva, Switzerland generated by the Compact Muon Solenoid as the particle accelerator attempts to trigger, reconstruct, and identify events with final state electrons. I successfully predict the mass of an electron by analyzing dielectron events in the mass range 2-110 GeV and use a machine learning algorithm to predict mass in subatomic particle collisions.

            <a href="pdf/time_series.pdf">Time Series - Telecom Churn</a><br>
                This research report incorporates a Time Series to analyze data points in a Telecom Churn dataset to discover an internal structure. The Time series will generate a thorough accounting of findings such as seasonal variation or trends. Two objectives are to provide information on stationarity and autocorrelated data which will assist stakeholders and executives with insight into corporate business metrics.

            <a href="pdf/sentiment_analysis.pdf">Sentiment Analysis using Neural Networks</a><br>
            The objective of this research report is to create a NLP Neural Network to analyze the UCI Sentiment Labeled Sentences dataset. The dataset contains three subsets of customer reviews from wildly popular review sites including IMDB, Amazon, and Yelp. We can accomplish this objective by utilizing the TensorFlow Python library to analyze and forecast negative or positive sentiment. The overall goal of the analysis is to analyze metrics of customer preference by using text classification to produce useful predictions.
